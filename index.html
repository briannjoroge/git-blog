    <h1>EVERYDAY GIT</h1>
    <p>
      In the world of software development, change is constant. Code evolves
      rapidly, features are added, bugs are fixed, and improvements are made. To
      keep track of these changes and to collaborate effectively, developers
      rely on tools called <b>version control systems</b>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>What is a Version Control System ?</h2>
    <p>
      A Version Control System is a tool that helps developers track and manage
      changes to their code over time. There are several Version Control Systems
      and they include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helix Core</li>
      <li>Mercurial</li>
      <li>Subversion</li>
      <li>AWS CodeCommit</li>
      <li>Git</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The above list is not comprehesive there are more version control Systems
      out there. In this blog I will discuss more on Git.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>What is git ?</h2>
      <p>
        Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in
        source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to
        work on the same project at the same time without interfering with each
        other’s work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having known what is Git, I will take you through the process of
        installing and configuting Git in your system. The first step will be
        checking whether git is installed in your system.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Checking if Git is installed</h3>
      </p> To check if git is installed in your system open the
      command line and run the command below:
      </p>

      <p><em>git --version</em></p>

      <figure>
        <img src="./images/check-version.png" alt="results of git --version" width="400" />
        <figcaption>Checking if git is installed</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        If You get a response similar to the one above the you already have git
        installed in you system
      </p>
      <p>
        If git is not installed and you are in a windows machines you will get a
        messsage like:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable
          program or batch file.</em>
      </p>
      <p>if you are in a linux machine you will get some similar to this</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/git-not-installed.png" alt="git not installed response" width="400" />
        <figcaption>
          Response when git is not installed in a linux machine
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        To install Git we first need to download it. Visit the webpage
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">HERE</a> to download Git and make
        sure you download one that is compatible with your operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        After installing git, run the command <em>git --version</em> in the command
        line to be sure git is set up successfully in your system. If everything works
        as expected then we can proceed and configure git.
      </p>
    </div>

  <h3>Configuring GIT</h3>
  <p>In this section we will configure the email and username .</p>
  <h4>Configuring the username</h4>
  <p>
    To configure the username, run the following command
  </p>
  <p><em>git config --global user.name</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/config-username.png" alt="configure username" width="400">
    <figcaption>Configuring the username</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>To check the current set username run the fllowing command:</p>
  <p><em>git config user.name</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/check-configured-username.png" alt="check set username" width="400">
    <figcaption>Checking the current set/configured username</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>After cinfiguring the username we can proceed to configure the email </p>
  <h4>Configuring the email</h4>
  <p>To configure the email run the following </p>
  <p><em>git config --global user.email "johndoe123@gmail.com"</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/configure-email.png" alt="configure email" width="400">

  </figure>
  <h3>Intializing a Git repository</h3>
  <p>A Git repository is the central location for storing and managing all the files and their
    version history for a project. It allows developers to track changes, collaborate, and manage
    different versions of their codebase efficiently.</p>
  <p>There are two types of Git repositories:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Local Repository: </b>A local repository exists on your computer and allows you to track
      changes, commit updates, and manage your project without needing an internet connection.</li>
    <li><b>Remote Repository: </b>A remote repository is stored on a server or cloud-based platform like GitHub and is
      designed for collaboration, enabling multiple developers to push their changes, pull updates
      from others, and keep the project synchronized.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Before initializing a Git repository we first need to check if the current working directory is a Git repository,
    to do so, run the following command:
  </p>
  <p><em>git status</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/git-status.png" alt="git status" width="400">
    <figcaption>Checking if the current working directory is a git repository</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Based on the above results, we can conclude that we are not in a git repository. We can now proceed to
    intializing one by running the command below:
  </p>
  <p><em>git init</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/initialize-repo.png" alt="git init command results" width="450">
    <figcaption>Intializing a Git repository</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The hightled messsage is what we are looking for, it basically tell us that our repository was
    initialized successfully.</p>
  <p>Reruning the <em>git status</em> command we get:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/git-status-rerun.png" alt="git status" width="400">
    <figcaption>Checking if the current working directory is a git repository</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h3>Adding files to the staging area</h3>
  <p>Once you’ve created a Git repository, the next step is to add your files to the <b>staging
      area</b> in preparation for committing.</p>
  <p><b>The staging area </b>in Git is an intermediate area where changes can be formatted and
    reviewed before committing them to the repository.
  </p>
  <p>To add files to the staging area run the following command: </p>
  <p><em>git add .</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/git-add.png" alt="git add . command" width="400">
    <figcaption>Adding files to the staging area</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h4>Tracked files vs Untracked files</h4>
  <p><b>Tracked files</b> are files that have been added to the repository and are being monitored by Git.
    This includes files that have been committed and those that have been added to the staging area but not yet
    committed.
  </p>
  <p><b>Untracked files</b> are files that have been created in the working directory but have not yet been added to the
    staging area.</p>
  <p> you can run <em>git status</em> to check the status of the files</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/tracked-untracked.png" alt="git status" width="450">
    <figcaption>Checking the status if files</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The files in green are tracked files and have aready been added to the staging area ready for committing while the
    files in red are
    untracked files and have not yet been added to the staging area</p>
  <h3>Commiting changes</h3>
  <p>After adding your changes in the staging area, the next step is to commit the changes. To make a commit we run the
    following:</p>
  <p><em>git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"</em></p>
  <p>The commit message should anser what the commit is doing eg adding a specific file, modifying the index.html,
    fixing a bug etc</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/make-a-commit.png" alt="git commit -m" width="550">
    <figcaption>Making a Git commit</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h4>Viewing past commits</h4>
  <p>To view past commits we run the command:</p>
  <p><em>git log</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/git-log.png" alt="git log" width="550">
    <figcaption>View past commits</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>My repository has 2 commits as shown above</p>
  <p>the components of a git commit include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hash - a unique identifier for the commit</li>
    <li>commit message - purpose for the commit</li>
    <li>author - the person making the commit</li>
    <li>timestamp - time and date when the commit is made</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sometimes in repository can have hundrends of commits, to summarize the ouput of <em>git log</em> we add the flag
    <em>--oneline</em></p>
  <p><em>git log --oneline</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/git-log-oneline.png" alt="git log --oneline" width="400">
    <figcaption>Summarize the ouput of git log command</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h4>Going back to a specific commit</h4>
  <p>To go back to a specific commit we run the command:</p>
  <p><em>git checkout COMMIT_HASH</em></p>
  <p>In our case we can go back to the first commit when we did not have the upload.js file</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/go-to-specific-commit.png" alt="git checkout" width="500">
    <figcaption>Going back to a specific commit</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The above screenshot shows that we have succesffully gone back to the first commit when we did not have the
    upload.js file in our repository.</p>
  <h3>Branches</h3>
  <p> Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that
    main line</p>
  <p>Branches are essential for managing different versions of your codebase, allowing developers to work on separate
    tasks without affecting the main project.</p>
  <p>The best use case for branching is when you want to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments simultaneously
    without affecting the main codebase.</p>
  <h4>Creating a new branch</h4>
  <p>To create a new branch run the following command:</p>
  <p><em>git branch BRANCH_NAME</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/create-branch.png" alt="git branch BRANCH_NAME" width="400">
    <figcaption>Creating a new branch</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <h4>Viewing all branches</h4>
  <p>To view all branches in your repository, you need to run the command:</p>
  <p><em>git branch</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/view-all-branches.png" alt="git branch" width="400">
    <figcaption>Viewing all branches in the working repository</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>the asterick (<b>*</b>) basically shows the current active branch, in simpler terms, it shows the branch you are
    currently working in.</p>
  <h4>Switching active branches</h4>
  <p>Times come when you want to switch from a the main branch to a testing branch or another branch and work on a
    feature or bug without affecting you main
    codebase. To switch active branches we basically run:</p>
  <p><em>git switch BRANCH_NAME</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/switch-branch.png" alt="git switch BRANCH_NAME">
    <figcaption>Switching active branches</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>After switching the active branch you can run the <em>git branch</em> command to confirm the new active branch
    shown by the asterick <b>(*)</b></p>
  <p>In my case I switched from the master branch to the testing branch</p>
  <p><em><b>NOTE: </b>After working in one branch make sure you add the changes to the staging area and commit the
      changes before switching to another branch to avoid carrying your changes with you as you switch to the other
      branch.</em></p>
  <h3>Merging a branch</h3>
  <p>Merging a branch in Git involves combining changes from one branch into another.</p>
  <p>For example in the testing branch, am testing a new feature and now the feature is fully developed and I want to
    bring it over the the master branch where my main codebase is.</p>
  <p>In this scenario I need to merge the branches, to do so I should run the following command: </p>
  <p><em>git merge BRANCH_NAME</em></p>
  <P>before running the command, since am bring changes from the testing branch into the master branch, i should first
    switch into the master branch then run the command.</P>
  <p><em>git merge testing</em></p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/merge.png" alt="git merge BRANCH_NAME" width="400">
    <figcaption>Merging branches</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The flow of command should be, in this case.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>git switch testing :</b> to switch to the testing branch.</li>
    <li>work on the new feature, bug fixes etc. in this case create the file new-feature.js</li>
    <li><b>git add .</b> : to add the new files and changes in to the staging area.</li>
    <li><b>git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE" :</b> to commit the changes in the stageing area.</li>
    <li><b>git switch master :</b> switch back to the master branch.</li>
    <li><b>git merge testing :</b> To bring changes in the testing branch over to the master branch.</li>
  </ul>
  <figure>
    <img src="./images/process-of-merging.png" alt="the steps involved before merging">
    <figcaption>Flow of commands when working with differen branches and when merging</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The <em>ls</em> command is just there to show us the availability of the new-feature.js file, which only comes
    available in the master branch after merging it with the testing branch.</p>
  <h4>Deleting a branch</h4>
  <p>After working a branch and merging it with the master branch, it becomes of no use to still have it in our
    repository unless you want to work with it later. to delete a branch we simply run the following command</p>
  <p><em>git branch -d BRANCH_NAME</em></p>
  <p>In this case suppose i want to delete the testing branch, i should run <em>git branch -d testing</em>
  </p>
